This is a header-\/only, generic, data analysis system that allows for creating performant generation of {\itshape Plots}. {\itshape Plots} contain {\itshape Values} and can make use of {\itshape Filters}. {\itshape Filters} can also depend of {\itshape Values}, and {\itshape Values} can depend on other {\itshape Values}. A {\itshape Dataset} is a generic object that contains a series of observations. The individual observations consist of a series of {\itshape Observed Values}. One can also define {\itshape Derived Values} which are calculated from {\itshape Observed Values} or other {\itshape Derived Values}. Care is taken automatically so {\itshape Derived Values} are calculated at most once per observation.
